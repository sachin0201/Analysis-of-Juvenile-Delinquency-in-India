# Analysis-of-Juvenile-Delinquency-in-India (Published 2 Papers)

The project is mainly focused on predicting and classifying which state/UT needs more awareness regarding juvenile delinquency. The Indian states and union territories will be classified based on the juvenile crime statistics for a period of 10 years (2001-2010) and will be graded into four classes, where each class will depict the level of awareness against juvenile crimes required in a state or UT. Levels to classify the states are: Relaxed-Awareness-Required, Focused- Awareness-Required,     High-Awareness- Required and Alarmingly-High-Awareness- Required. 

Kaggle dataset, ‘Crime-In-India’ is used as the source of data. This dataset contains complete information about various aspects of crimes happened in India from 2001 till 2010, which also provides a link between crime rates and the education level of juveniles who performed crime. 

The lack of awareness in the society against juvenile delinquency is a major concern and challenge for the Indian society which needs immediate attention. With the application of the project, it is an attempt to bring attention towards the need for stricter vigilance and awareness against juvenile crimes in Indian states & union territories based on their juvenile crime-statistics. 

The classification is done by using one of the classical data mining classification techniques: K-Nearest-Neighbors Classification. This project includes the visualization for the dataset as well as for the final evaluated results. This classification will help us in understanding which states/UTs are vigilant about juvenile delinquency and which states require more awareness & stricter vigilance against juvenile delinquency.
